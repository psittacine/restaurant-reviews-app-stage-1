#### Project Overview

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use by using Cache API and a Service Worker.

### Instructions:

To run the application, load `index.html` in a web browser, or view it live [here](https://psittacine.github.io/restaurant-reviews-app-stage-1/).

To start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer:

1. In a terminal from inside the project directory, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With the server running, access the site in a web browser at: `http://localhost:8000`
